        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Stephanie Lynn "Stevie" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona to Jess and Barbara Nicks. 
            <br>Nicks is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry.
            <br><br>Nicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess "A.J." Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. 
            <br>Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home "more than most people" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.
            <br><br>As a toddler, Stephanie could pronounce her own name only as "tee-dee", which led to her nickname of "Stevie".

        <h2>Fleetwood Mac</h2>
        <p>Nicks and Buckingham attended San José State University, where Nicks majored in speech communication and planned to 
            <br>become an English teacher. With her father's blessing, she dropped out of college to pursue a musical career with Buckingham.
            <br><br>After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write as a duo, recording demo tapes at night in Daly City,
            <br>California, on a one-inch, four-track Ampex tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee-roasting plant belonging to his father.
            <br>They secured a deal with Polydor Records, and the eponymous Buckingham Nicks was released in 1973. The album was not a 
            <br>commercial success and Polydor dropped the pair.
            <br><br>On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham, inviting him to join the band. Buckingham refused, insisting that Nicks 
            <br>and he were "a package deal" and he would not join without her. The group decided that incorporating the pair would improve 
            <br>Fleetwood Mac, making the British band into an Anglo-American one. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the 
            <br>harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the band's former style of blues-based rock.
            <br><br>In 1975, Fleetwood Mac achieved worldwide success with the album Fleetwood Mac. Nicks's "Rhiannon" was voted one of The 
            <br>500 Greatest Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone. Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a 
            <br>theatrical intensity which differs from how the song plays on the album. The song built to a climax in which Nicks's vocals were so 
            <br>impassioned that Mick Fleetwood declared, "her 'Rhiannon' in those days was like an exorcism." "Landslide" became another 
            <br>hit from the album, with three million airplays.

        <h2>Solo Career</h2>
        <p>Nicks's first solo album, Bella Donna, was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the 
            <br>Billboard 200 chart, with four singles making the Billboard Hot 100, and Rolling Stone deeming her "the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".
            <br><br>Nicks released her second solo album, The Wild Heart, on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five on the 
            <br>Billboard 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer Sandy Stewart as co-writer and vocalist.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Nicks's style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and 
            <br>shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual," writes New 
            <br>York Times reporter Ruth La Ferla.
            <br><br>Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song "Gypsy" on Fleetwood Mac's 13th studio album Mirage, released 
            <br>in 1982. In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California, where famous rockers 
            <br>like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.
            <br><br>Many artists have cited Nicks as a source of influence and musical inspiration. These include Beyoncé and Destiny's Child, Courtney Love, 
            <br>Michelle Branch, Belinda Carlisle, The Chicks (formerly known as Dixie Chicks), Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Nadia Ali, Florence Welch, 
            <br>Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Vanessa Carlton, Delta Goodrem, and Lorde.
