Topic Framing


(2) What was the subject or the text you chose to reframe your imagery?

Unnatural objects, occurances, and situations in nature.


(3) Title of your Book / Project: Unnatural Things In Nature


(4) Description: A short description (1 sentence to 2 paragraphs) for your book collection.

Collection Description: I was inspired to do this project after I went on a road trip to the Great Sand Dunes in Colorado. Throughout my drive, I saw so many beautiful things in nature, and then every once and a while I would stumble across something that didn't seem to belong. I thought it was so beautiful and really spoke to our current state to see these extremely unnatural occurances. This project depicts the human impact on the natural world, and how it can sometimes create something new and beautiful, and other times destroy the natural beauty that existed before it. 
I hope this inspires people to try harder to leave no trace.
