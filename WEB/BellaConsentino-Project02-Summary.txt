Assignment 2, Tell a Story with a Moving Image

(1) What story did you choose to tell? (An Existing or New Story? / Retell a children's story?)

Existing Story (repetitive life of a student)


(2) Title of your Project: Like Clockwork

(3) Tell us the plot to your story / Give a description of your project

Every day the student wakes up and does the same thing, so much so that the days bleed into each other and morph into one mundane blob. That is, until someone bumps into them and takes them out of the cycle.

"I Got You Babe" by Cher & Sonny
